# TodoList

A todo list application created using ASP.NET and React

## Features
- Create todos
- Mark todos as complete
- Filter todos by name
- Delete todos

## Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to write a simple ASP.NET Minimal API
- Learned how to make a basic React frontend
- Learned how to connect the two

## Installation
You may have to configure the urls in the frontend's fetch requests, as I hard coded them to my local backend's port. Just change the port part of the address `localhost:____` to whatever port the backend gives you when you start it.
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/TylerMcKenna/TodoList.git`
2. Open two terminals and navigate both into the project directory `cd TodoList`
3. Navigate one terminal to the backend `cd TodoApi`
4. Start the backend `dotnet run`
5. Navigate the other terminal to the frontend `cd frontend`
6. Start the frontend `npm run dev`
7. Navigate to the address provided by the frontend
